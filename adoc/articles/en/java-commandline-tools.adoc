== Command line tools for Java

image::https://www.dieckmann-aroma-kaffee.de/images/blog/kaffeemuehle.jpg[]

In the book "97 Things every Java Programmer should know" (I contributed 2 of the 97 tips) there is a chapter about some command line tools in the JDK.

Since I make heavy use of such helpers myself, I wanted to briefly introduce them in today's article.

Personally I prefer the command line for my daily work, using the combination of `git`, `sed`, `grep`, `bash` commands etc. makes recurring tasks easier.

Already in the "Pragmatic Programmer" [PragProg], there was a clear reference to this in section 21:

____
Use the Power of Command Shells+
Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.
____

I would also like to refer to the book "Productive Programmer" [NealFord].

You don't have to be afraid of the command line, it's like any programming language, you execute commands or scripts and can combine their inputs and outputs to more complex processes.
On Linux and OSX you are well served with the built-in bash or zsh, on Linux you can be happy either on the `cmd` prompt or since recently with the Linux Subsystem for Windows (WLS).

Most of the tools come with a built-in help with the `-h` parameter, or provide help pages using `man <commandoname>`.
These can also be found on the Oracle website [ManPages].

== Managing installations with SDKman

As mentioned in previous articles, for me sdkman is the management genius par excellence to install Java, Groovy, Maven, Gradle, Micronaut and many other tools and to activate different versions.

To do this you install sdkman e.g. with: `curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash`.

After that `sdk list` shows the installable tools and with `sdk list java` you can see available and installed versions of JDKs.
You have a wide choice from OpenJDK over Azul Zuulu, GraalVM to Amazon and SAP JDKs.

With e.g. `sdk install java 14.0.1-zulu` you can install new versions (up to the last EAP) and with `sdk use java 15.ea.27-open` you can switch for the current shell or globally.

== Simple helpers

In every JRE and JDK there are a lot of useful helpers in the `bin` directory of the distribution besides the `javac` compiler and the `java` runtime environment.
Some of them, like jarsigner or keytool are very special and I will not go into them here.
We will start with some useful tools and then give the more complex ones a separate section each.

=== jps

If you want to get rid of a hanging Java process you can either search for it in the TaskManager and close it there, or find the PID (Process ID) with `ps auxww | grep java` and then terminate it with `kill <pid>`.

Instead, the built-in `jps` can do the same service.
Additional options are `-l` for FQN of main class or path to startup JAR, `-v` for JVM arguments, and `-m` for command line arguments for `main` method.

=== jstack

To get a thread dump of a JVM, especially if it is stuck at a point you want to examine more closely, there are 2 ways.
Either a `kill -3 <pid>` produces the output directly from the process, or better with `jstack <pid>`.

Thereby jstack can also force stalled processes to output with the "force" `-F` flag, which you can then redirect to a file for example.
With `jstack -l <pid>` you get additional output about locks, deadlocks are also shown.

The status of the threads differs between `kill -3` and `jstack`.

[opts=header,cols="m,m"]
|===
| kill -3 | jstack
| RUNNABLE | IN_NATIVE
| TIMED_WAITING | BLOCKED
| WAITING | BLOCKED (PARK)
|===

=== jinfo

Using `jinfo` you can quickly access system properties, JVM flags, and JVM arguments of a Java process.

A `jinfo <pid>` gives a complete overview, which can help in detecting strange effects.
Using `jinfo <pid> -flag name=value` or `-flag [+|-]name` you can change dynamic JVM flags.
// todo, example

=== jshell

Introduced in Java 9, `jshell` was the first official REPL (read eval print loop) console for interactive execution of Java code.
Not only can expressions be computed and variables assigned, but classes with methods can be created and overridden dynamically.

One can pass classpaths to jshell, whose contents are then available for import and use.

`jshell` has a lot of command line options and also built-in commands, which are explained using `/?`.
Especially useful are `/help`, `/save`, `/history` and the list commands `/vars`, `/types`, `/methods`,`/imports`.

For editing larger code fragments you can use `/edit <name>`, creating your own editor using environment variables `JSHELLEDITOR, VISUAL, EDITOR` or `set editor /path/to/editor`.

Important packages like `java.util.(*,streams,concurrent)`, `java.math` and some others are already imported by default.

Expressions are assigned to placeholders `$5`, which can be used again later.
Better readable is to use `var` from Java 11 on, then variables can be created without type declaration.
New language features that are still available in preview mode can be enabled `--enable-preview`.

A very handy feature of `jshell` is the auto-completion. 
Each class, method and variable name can be contextually completed by pressing <tab> several times.

Here is an example to run Game of Life (Rest in Peace - John Conway) in `jshell`.

== jar

To deal with jar files (Java ARchive) there is a command of the same name.
The command line syntax is similar to the `tar` command.
While `tar` only stores files in an archive, `jar` also compresses them which leads to a significant reduction in size.

Here are some useful applications:

* `jar tf file.jar` - display the contents
* `jar xvf file.jar` - decompress the file in the current directory (with display by `v`)
* `jar uvf file.jar -C path test.txt` - add a file from the specified directory

Since Java 9 `jar` can also create multi-release archives, these are then compatible with multiple JDKs and can contain optimized class files for the respective Java version.

== java

The Java command starts the Java Virtual Machine, with the given classpath (directories, files and URLs of jar and classes) and a main class whose main method is executed.

With `java -jar file.jar` the main class is determined from the meta information of the jar file instead.

Since Java 11 JEP 330 is available, so source files can be executed directly.

[source,java]
----
cat > Hello.java <<EOF
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String...args) {
        System.out.println("Hello "+String.join(" ",args)+"!");
    }
}
EOF
java Hello.java JEP 330
----

If the first line of the file says `#!/usr/bin/java --source 10`, it can even be executed directly. 

[source,java]
----
cat > hello <<EOF
#!/usr/bin/java --source 10
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String...args) {
        System.out.println("Hello "+String.join(" ",args)+"!");
    }
}
EOF
chmod +x hello
./hello JEP 330
----

The JVM can be controlled with hundreds of flags [JVMFlags], from memory allocation with `-Xmx` and `-Xms` to garbage collector selection with `-XG1GC` and log settings.

A few useful flags follow, the list represents only a fraction of the JVM options.

- `HeapDumpOnOutOfMemory`
- ...

== Javac

The `javac` compiler translates Java source code into one or more class files, containing the bytecode of the classes, performing initial optimizations and triggering the processing of annotations by "annotation processors".
To specify all classes on which the current code depends, they or their archives must be listed in the classpath.

== JavaP

Whenever you want to examine the result of Javac, `javap` comes into play.
This tool allows to display the signature of a class, its memory layout with `-l -v -constants` and with `-c` the bytecode instructions of the JVM stack language.
This can be useful if you want to see the effect of certain compiler options or Java versions, or if the behavior of optimizations has changed (inlining size).

As parameter it gets the fully qualified class name, file name or jar URL.

Here is an example of our `Hello.java` class, where you can see for example that Java 14 now uses an "invokedynamic" operation for string concatenation.

----
javap -c Hello

Compiled from "Hello.java"
public class Hello {
  // Konstruktor mit Super-Konstruktor Aufruf
  public Hello();
    Code:
       // lade "this" auf Stack
       0: aload_0
       4: return

  public static void main(java.lang.String...);
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #7                  // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
       3: ldc           #13                 // String
       // lade 1. Parameter auf den Stack, also "args"
       5: aload_0
       6: invokestatic  #15                 // Method java/lang/String.join:(Ljava/lang/CharSequence;[Ljava/lang/CharSequence;)Ljava/lang/String;
       // Stringverkettung
       9: invokedynamic #21,  0             // InvokeDynamic #0:makeConcatWithConstants:(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/String;
      14: invokevirtual #25                 // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
      17: return
}
----

=== JMAP

To create heapdumps or histograms of (referenced) objects `jmap` was helpful.
Currently it is recommended to use `jcmd`.

* `jmap -clstats <pid>` output classloader statistics
* `jmap --histo <pid>` or `-histo:live` histogram of the 
* `jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=heap.hprof <pid>` Generate heap dump.

=== JCMD

Using `jcmd` Java processes can be controlled remotely, there are quite a few actions that can be triggered in the JVM.
jcmd can be used interactively or by command line parameters.

Using `jcmd <pid/main-class> <command>` the specific actions can be triggered, multiple commands are separated with newlines.
Thereby `jcmd <pid/main-class> help` gives information about which commands are possible.

== Java Flight Recorder (jfr)

Java Flight Recorder is a runtime tracing mechanism that allows to record various events of activities that take place in the JVM and correlate them with the activity of the application.
Everything from JIT optimizations, garbage collection, safepoints and even custom evetns are possible.

The `jfr` tool allows to read and display Java Flight Recorder files (`print`, `summary` and `metadata`).
This can be done in a readable text format or JSON/XML (`--json, --xml`).

* `print` represents the whole event log
* `metadata` shows which events were recorded (event classes)
* `summary` shows in a histogram which events have been recorded how often

----

To limit the amount of information categories can be filtered via `--categories "GC,JVM,Java*"` and events via `--events CPULoad,GarbageCollection` or `--events "jdk.*"`.
Unfortunately this is not possible with summary or metadata, only with `print`.

The better tool to evaluate JFR records is of course Mission Control [JMC], which is released as OpenSource since Java 11? and is also offered by other vendors like Azul [ZuluMC].

== jdeprscan

Since some components of the JDK have been discontinued in recent years, `jdeprscan` allows to scan classes, directories or jar files for the usage of these APIs.

Example:

----
jdeprscan --release 11 testcontainers/testcontainers/1.9.1/testcontainers-1.9.1.jar 2>&1 | grep -v 'error: cannot '
Jar file testcontainers/testcontainers/1.9.1/testcontainers-1.9.1.jar:

class org/testcontainers/shaded/org/apache/commons/io/input/ClassLoaderObjectInputStream
  uses deprecated method java/lang/reflect/Proxy::getProxyClass(Ljava/lang/Class
----

With `jdeprscan --list --release 11` you can list the APIS that were deprecated in that release.

   9 javax.swing.JComponent
   8 java.util.concurrent
----

== Other tools

There are of course many more important tools for working with the JVM, from `async-profiler` and `jol` (Java Object Layout) to graphical programs for parsing and displaying GC logs (gceasy.io), JFR recordings (jmc) or heap dumps (jvisualvm, Eclipse-MAT).

Other tools like the Java debugger `jdb` are far inferior to the capabilities of the IDEs for convenient debugging, whether on the local or remote machines.

== Conclusion

The helpers that come with the JDK can make your life easier if you know about their capabilities and how to combine them with each other and other shell tools.
It is definitely worth trying them out and learning more about them.
