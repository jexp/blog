April shares the first two letters with https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures[APOC, our community driven procedure and function library for Neo4j's Cypher].

That's why I thought it would be a good idea to use the http://neo4j.com/blog/apoc-spring-release[APOC spring release] to kick off a of blossom of articles and demos on how to use APOC in really cool ways.

In this *APOC Awareness Month* we will honor blog posts published in April that demonstrate cool applications of APOC with an Amazon Gift Certificate of $100.

We will award at *least 10 prizes*, with the goal of handing out 5 per week.
So be early if you want to catch one.

NOTE: If you are an Neo Technology employee you are unfortuntately not eligible but we encourage you to publish anyway.

Everyone who publishes an interesting article, even if you don't win a prize, you'll get a one-and-only APOC t-shirt from us

////
To help you fight procrastination and not have everyone publish on the last day of the month, I thought it would be good to add a bonus for early publishers.
You get an *extra $50* if you publish *before* the majority of the articles comes out, i.e. if you're in the first half of publications.
////

Of course your articles will be promoted on Twitter, the weekly Neo4j compilation and a summary blog post at the end of the month.

== How to Submit

Just, follow http://twitter.com[@neo4j] and tweet out your article link and picture with the hashtags *#neo4j #apoc*

We will find it, have a look at your article, and DM you for your email address to send the Amazon Gift Certificate or an equivalent if the certificates don't work for you.

== Here are the content rules

1. You demonstrate how to use APOC procedures and functions 
2. You use a realistic graph model
3. You show how to import/migrate/export some data using that graph model and APOC
4. You query the graph with at least 3 different, interesting Cypher queries
5. Your article teaches in a nice way, using graphics (e.g. model, screenshots), Cypher-code and well written prose

== Interesting data-sources and -sinks to integrate with

* Data sources like MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MongoDB, CouchBase, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Spark, Flink etc.
* APIs like GitHub, StackOverflow, Twitter, Trello, other Atlassian Tools, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Facebook, etc.
* Datasets from public sources (governments, non-profits), competitions, public sources or scraped results (e.g. with import.io)
* ML tools and libraries like iPython Notebooks, Zeppelin, Tensorflow, Keras, Open.AI, Apache Beam, scikit-learn etc.
* Visualization libraries like Gephi, D3, Cytoscape, OGMA, viz.js etc.
* Any many others that you might come up with
