== Poor Mans "indexOf"

Index-of is the same as the length of the string before the first occurence of the term
So if we split our string by the term, it would be the length of the first splice.

RETURN length(split(toLower(string,"term")[0]);

If we wanted all indexs it would be another "reduce"

WITH split(toLower(string,"term") as parts
RETURN reduce(i=[],x in range(0,length(parts)-2) | i + [coalesce(i[x-1],0) + len(parts[x]) + length(term)] )



START u=node:node_auto_index("fullName:*jay*") 
MATCH (u:User) 
WITH distinct u
RETURN {firstName : u.firstName , lastName : u.lastName, fullName : u.fullName, profilePicture : u.profilePicture, id : u.id} as user
ORDER BY length(split(toLower(u.fullName,"jay")[0]);
