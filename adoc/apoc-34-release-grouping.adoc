= APOC Release for Neo4j 3.4 with Graph Grouping

Just in time for the Neo4j 3.4.0 release, we also pushed out two versions of APOC, namely 3.3.0.3 and 3.4.0.1.
You can download them from https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[GitHub^], Maven or most conveniently with a single click in Neo4j Desktop.

WARNING: Please note that the "self upgrade" process in Neo4j Desktop might leave the previous APOC version in your `plugins` directory, you'll have to remove it yourself if your DB is tripping over it.

This time, we had to spend much more effort on updating the internals, as Neo4j 3.4. comes with a new SPI (Kernel API) for more effiecient interaction with the Cypher runtime.

As APOC uses that SPI in a number of places, we can thank https://twitter.com/darthvader42[Stefan Armbruster^] who took on the job of updating all of those. 

*I also want to thank everyone who contributed or https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/issues[reported back issues^] or feature requests.*


Although this is release is lighter on features, there are two things that made it in, which I hope will make all your lives easier.

== Load Excel (XLS)

Much of the business data is still living in Excel today, as quick computation, summariziation, charts and formatting is very handy.
And as I learned a long time ago, from https://www.slideshare.net/kfrdbs/peyton-jones[Simon Peyton Jones^], Excel's expression language is the most widely used, immutable functional language in the world.

One other feature that is very useful is to group data that belongs together into several sheets of the same file.
That's the main difference, between `apoc.load.xls` and `apoc.load.csv` that you can address individual sheets or even regions.

We use the Apache POI library to read excel, but as I didn't want to grow APOC by many megabytes you'll have to add these dependencies yourself if you want to use excel loading.

The are linked in the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_load_csv_and_xls[documentation for both procedures^].
Those two also come with a number of other cool features such as:

* provide a line number
* provide both a map and a list representation of each line
* automatic data conversion (including split into arrays)
* option to keep the original string formatted values
* ignoring fields (makes it easier to assign a full line as properties)
* headerless files
* replacing certain values with null

So if you have a sheet like this, you can not just access the individual Sheets, but also an region like shown here.
The name of the sheet is `Offset` so don't get confused :)

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.xls('file:///path/to/file.xls','Offset!B2:F3',
  {mapping:{Integer:{type:'int'}, Array:{type:'int',array:true,arraySep:';'}}})
----

Resulting in:

[opts=header,cols="5*m"]
|===
| String | Boolean | Integer | Float | Array
| "Test" | true | 2 | 1.5 | [1,2,3]
|===

== Graph Grouping

The other feature that I'm really happy about is *graph grouping*.
Quite some time ago, https://twitter.com/kc1s[Martin Junghanns^] told me about the graph operators in https://github.com/dbs-leipzig/gradoop_demo#graph-grouping[Gradoop^], one of which is graph grouping.

I found that a really cool and useful idea, so I implemented a first version in APOC a while ago.

1. This is a way of summarizing a graph by grouping nodes by one or more properties, resulting in virtual nodes that represent these groups.
2. Then for each of the virtual nodes all of the relationships between each group are aggregated too.
3. And you can provide additional aggregation functions for both nodes and relationships besides just counting them, e.g. sum of values or min/max of timestamps, that also turn into properties of the aggregated graph entities.

The https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_node_grouping[documentation for this procedure^] also details all the command line and configuration options, like skipping orphans or post-filtering the results.

Here is a quick example:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.nodes.group(['User'],['country','gender'])
YIELD node, relationship RETURN *;
----

This is especially helpful to get an birds eye view of the graph, like a summarization.

So you can e.g. group a _User graph by country and gender_ or a _citation-graph by publication year_.

As Martin and Max had built a nice Javascript application demoing that feature, I could take it and adapt it to a Neo4j / APOC backend.

You will find the adapted source code in this https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-grouping/issues[GitHub repository^].

It is self contained and even https://rawgit.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-grouping/master/index.html[hosts a running app^].

image::https://github.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-grouping/raw/master/img/group-user-country.jpg[link=https://rawgit.com/neo4j-examples/neo4j-grouping/master/index.html]

As part of this I also added https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/#_node_functions[a number of functions^] to access node and relationship attributes that also work with virtual nodes and relationships.

Going forward I want to make it run on graph projections and also improve performance further.

== Release Summary

=== Features/Improvements

* `apoc.load.xls` for loading data from Excel files, supports both xls and xlsx
* Improvements for `apoc.nodes.group`, e.g. filtering of rel-types or of outputs by counts
* Accessor functions for (virtual) entities (e.g. to postfilter them by property or label)
* dijkstra algorithm supporting multiple results
* `date.format(null)` returns null, also add ISO8601 convenience format


=== Bugfixes

* fix for `apoc.periodic.iterate` with statements that already started with `WITH`
* fix for deleted nodes in explicit index
* `apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed` uses separate thread
* Missing Iterator Utils in apoc .jar file
* Add missing `apoc.coll.combinations()`
* check for availability before running sync index update thread

=== Documentation

* docs for `apoc.load.csv` and `apoc.load.xls`
* docs for `apoc.group.nodes`
* docs for `apoc.coll.contains`


So please go ahead and try out the new features and update your APOC dependency to the last version.

You should also make it a habit to learn one new APOC procedure or function each day, there more than are enough for every day of the year :)
Start with `CALL apoc.help('keyword')` to not get lost anymore.
